CPU Baseline (Reference)

Operation: 3×3 Convolution (9 MACs)
Implementation: C / Python (single-threaded)
Platform: ARM Cortex-A9 @ 667 MHz (Zynq PS)

---

Estimated Performance:

Single convolution:
- 9 multiply-accumulate operations
- Executed sequentially
- ~50-100 cycles including memory access

Full 224×224 image with 3×3 kernel:
- (224-2) × (224-2) = 49,284 windows
- 9 MACs per window = 443,556 MACs
- ~5-10 ms on ARM Cortex-A9

Used as reference for FPGA speedup analysis.
FPGA achieves 9× reduction in cycles for single window.
System-level speedup depends on data transfer overhead.
