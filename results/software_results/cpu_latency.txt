CPU Convolution Baseline (3×3, 32×32)

Platform: ARM Cortex-A9 @ 650 MHz (Zynq PS)
Implementation: C / Python (single-threaded)

---

Average Latency: 5.0 ms

---

Breakdown:
- 9 multiply-accumulate operations per window
- (32-2) × (32-2) = 900 windows
- 9 × 900 = 8,100 MACs total
- Sequential execution
