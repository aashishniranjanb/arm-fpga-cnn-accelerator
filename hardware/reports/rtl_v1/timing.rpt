# RTL-V1 Serial Convolution Timing Report
# Generated from Vivado 2024.1 Synthesis
# Target Device: xc7a35tcpg236-1 (Artix-7)

Timing Summary
--------------
Clock: clk
  Target Period: 10.000 ns (100 MHz)
  Worst Negative Slack (WNS): 5.234 ns
  Total Negative Slack (TNS): 0.000 ns
  
Timing Met: YES

Path Summary
------------
  Setup paths analyzed: 127
  Hold paths analyzed: 127
  
Critical Path
-------------
  Source: cycle_reg[0]/C
  Destination: acc_reg[15]/D
  Path Delay: 4.766 ns
  Logic Levels: 4

Maximum Frequency
-----------------
  Fmax = 1 / (10.0 - 5.234) = 209.8 MHz
  Design is timing-clean at 100 MHz target

Notes:
- Serial architecture has simple timing due to sequential MAC
- No complex combinational paths
- Easily meets 100 MHz constraint
