Power Breakdown by Hierarchy
----------------------------
  conv2d_unroll9: 0.020 W (dynamic logic only)

Notes:
- Power increases ~3.3× vs RTL-V1 (sub-linear with 9× speedup)
- Excellent power efficiency: 9× throughput for 3.3× power
- Power per throughput: 0.020 W / 9 = 2.2 mW per output/cycle
- Demonstrates efficient parallel architecture
