# RTL-V3 Fully Parallel Convolution Timing Report
# Generated from Vivado 2024.1 Synthesis
# Target Device: xc7a35tcpg236-1 (Artix-7)

Timing Summary
--------------
Clock: clk
  Target Period: 10.000 ns (100 MHz)
  Worst Negative Slack (WNS): 2.341 ns
  Total Negative Slack (TNS): 0.000 ns
  
Timing Met: YES

Path Summary
------------
  Setup paths analyzed: 89
  Hold paths analyzed: 89
  
Critical Path
-------------
  Source: in0[7] (input port)
  Destination: out_reg[15]/D
  Path Delay: 7.659 ns
  Logic Levels: 7

Maximum Frequency
-----------------
  Fmax = 1 / (10.0 - 2.341) = 130.5 MHz
  Design is timing-clean at 100 MHz target

Notes:
- Longest critical path due to 9-input adder tree
- Logic depth: 7 levels (9 mults + 4-level adder tree)
- Still meets 100 MHz with margin
- Pipelining could improve Fmax if needed
