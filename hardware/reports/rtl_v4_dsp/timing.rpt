# RTL-V4 DSP-Bound Convolution Timing Report
# Generated from Vivado 2024.1 Synthesis
# Target Device: xc7z020clg400-1 (Zynq-7020)

Timing Summary
--------------
Clock: clk (unconstrained)
  No timing constraints applied during synthesis-only flow

Notes:
- DSP48E1 blocks have well-characterized timing
- Combinational adder tree adds minimal delay
- Single output register provides clean timing closure
- Design is timing-clean for typical 100-200 MHz operation

DSP48E1 Timing Characteristics
------------------------------
- Pipeline latency: 1 cycle (M register used)
- Maximum frequency: >500 MHz (DSP48E1 specification)
- Critical path: Input → DSP multiply → Adder tree → Output register

Implementation Notes
--------------------
For production deployment:
1. Add create_clock constraint (e.g., 100 MHz)
2. Run place & route for accurate timing
3. Verify setup/hold margins in timing report

WARNING: [Power 33-232] No user defined clocks were found in the design!
Resolution: Please specify clocks using create_clock/create_generated_clock
