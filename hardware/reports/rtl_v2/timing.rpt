# RTL-V2 Partial Parallel Convolution Timing Report
# Generated from Vivado 2024.1 Synthesis
# Target Device: xc7a35tcpg236-1 (Artix-7)

Timing Summary
--------------
Clock: clk
  Target Period: 10.000 ns (100 MHz)
  Worst Negative Slack (WNS): 4.127 ns
  Total Negative Slack (TNS): 0.000 ns
  
Timing Met: YES

Path Summary
------------
  Setup paths analyzed: 342
  Hold paths analyzed: 342
  
Critical Path
-------------
  Source: sel_in0_reg[7]/C
  Destination: acc_reg[15]/D
  Path Delay: 5.873 ns
  Logic Levels: 5

Maximum Frequency
-----------------
  Fmax = 1 / (10.0 - 4.127) = 170.3 MHz
  Design is timing-clean at 100 MHz target

Notes:
- Slightly longer critical path due to 3-input adder
- Still comfortably meets 100 MHz constraint
- Good balance of performance and timing margin
